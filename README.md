# MySite
My personal website. 
This is my first attempt to make a so-called interactive resume. I wrote everything on my own with the
help of the Twitter Bootstrap framework. I used HTML, CSS, some JQuery and Javascript, and some PHP and Ajax.
It still has a few bugs that I need to improve on, like some glitches and its unresponsiveness going to screen
sizes like tablet and mobile screens. There's also some interfering with the scrollspy and the smooth scroll.
I update this page regularly so it'll be improved and more refined. If you see anything that you think is bad UI
or other bugs I might have missed, please let me know. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
