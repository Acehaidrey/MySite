# MySite
My personal website. 
This is my first attempt to make a so-called interactive resume. I wrote everything on my own with the
help of the Twitter Bootstrap framework. I used HTML, CSS, and some JQuery and Javascript to get the 
functionality.I have most of the baseline down but there are many minor gimmicks that I would like to 
improve on. One of the biggest things is scaling to mobile devices. Also there's some interfering with 
the scrollspy and the smooth scroll. I update this page regularly so it'll be improved and more refined.
If you see anything that really bugs you or find bugs in general, please let me know. Any help would be 
appreciated! Thanks!
