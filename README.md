# MySite
My personal website. 
This is my first attempt to make a socalled interactive resume. I have most of the baseline down but
there are many minor gimmicks that I would like to improve on. One of the biggest things is scaling to 
mobile devices. Also there's some interfering with the scrollspy and the smooth scroll. I update this
page regularly so it'll be improved and more refined. 
If you see anything that really bugs you or find bugs in general, please let me know. Any help would
be appreciated! Thanks!
